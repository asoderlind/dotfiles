# dotfiles

# Usage

To load for the first time, make sure you have stow installed and go to the `~/.local/bin` folder and create a new directory `statusbar`, then while standing in `dotfiles/src` run the executable file stowdot:

```.local/bin/stowdot```

The files and folders are now symlinked to the corresponding ones in the home directory.

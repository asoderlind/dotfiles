# dotfiles

# Usage

In `~/.config` run

```$ mkdir nvim picom shell zxhkd x11 tmux zathura zsh fonconfig lf```

In `~/.local/bin` run

```$ mkdir statusbar```

Make sure you have stow installed, then while standing in `dotfiles/src` run the executable file stowdot:

```$ .local/bin/stowdot```

The files are now symlinked to the corresponding ones in the home directory.
